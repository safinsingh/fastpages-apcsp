<p>For the most part, there were little to no discrepancies with any of my scoring and CollegeBoards. On the 4th student’s work, I thought that the student deserved the point for list data usage. However, because they only used a certain attribute of the list, CollegeBoard deemed it unworthy of recieving a 1 in that category. For my project, I’ll make sure to correctly use and explain the usage of data within any list I create so that I don’t miss this point in the future. I am already showcasing this in my implementation of the Todo API which is viewable at this <a href="https://github.com/safinsingh/flask-sqlalchemy-saakd/blob/master/saakd_api/api/todo.py">URL</a> The fourth submission did not meet the Data Abstractions criteria for the mentioned reason. It missed Managing Complexity due to insufficient management; it only had a counter which wasn’t enough for the points. Finally, the testing criteria was not met due to a lack of arguments for the tester function.</p>
