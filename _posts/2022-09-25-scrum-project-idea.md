title: SCRUM Project Idea

# Program purpose

We are creating a website called `Striver` that can keep track of your personal goals and share them with your peers. You will be able to like each other's goals and see a feed of goals that you and your friends have.

# Design

My team and I collaborated on a Google Drawing to mock up what our website will look like. We will use Bootstrap to design the components and Flask to template different pages. The like button will be an image that will switch to a different color once activated.

# SCRUM team role

My team and I decided on the following roles:

- Safin: SCRUM Master
- Kalani: Frontend
- Alex: Backend
- Navan: DevOps

As SCRUM master, I will make sure my team is always on task and meetings the deadlines set by Mr. M. I will oversee general development and help out on all aspects of our project where needed. We intend to use HTML/CSS/JS for our frontend and Python on the backend. The DevOps pipeline will be powered by GitHub Actions + some hosting provider (presumably AWS) and managed by Alex.

Here is a poster that my team and I created together to describe each role of a SCRUM team in detail!
