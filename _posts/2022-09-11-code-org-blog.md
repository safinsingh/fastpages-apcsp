# Initial Thinking

Alex and I want to build a quiz application that is user-friendly and easy to code. We want to avoid repetitive code so that we can have the most efficient programming experience. Our plan is to create an app that can support the selection of different quizzes given a dropdown selection. We want it to have 4 choices on each answer screen with only one correct answer. We also want to have a final screen which displays the score out of 3 as well as a percentage. There should be a way to go back to the main screen to retake a quiz or take the other quiz. Finally, there should be a "How to Play" screen for anyone confused about where to start.
