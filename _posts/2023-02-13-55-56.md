## 5.5

1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.

- Types of Licenses:
  - Open Source Licenses
    - Definition: Allows anyone to use the program without needing to pay
    - Example: MIT License
  - Closed Source Licenses
    - Definition: Require payment to authors based on what user makes from distribution
  - Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
    - Definition: Allows for the public to use the material without any copyright restrictions
  - Open Source MIT License
    - Definition: Allows for code to be used and then made into a closed source version for distribution
    - Requirements: Authors still want credit (comments)
  - Open Source GPL License
    - Definition: People can do anything with the project except distribute
    - Example: GNU GPLv3

2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.

- Reasons for Choosing Open Source GPL for Group Project

  - To allow others to use and learn from the program
  - To prevent unauthorized distribution for personal gain
  - To promote open access to such programs

- Legality and Ethics Considerations

  - Giving credit to sources used
  - Using digital rights to prevent piracy
  - Support for income generation by large companies

- Use of Open Source Licenses in Class
  - Encouraging learning and sharing of code
  - Understanding the role of licenses in income generation for companies
  - Balancing open access with profitability considerations

3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.

- Reasons for Choosing Open Source GPL License

  - To allow others to modify the code for learning purposes
  - To prevent unauthorized distribution for personal gain
  - To promote learning and experimentation with coding

- Use of GPL License for Fastpages and Group Flask and Github Pages Website
  - Encouraging exploration and development of code
  - Balancing open access with the need to protect intellectual property
  - Fostering a community of learning and innovation in coding

## 5.6

1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

- Password usage in example CPT project
- Classroom-specific information (class numbers, periods, etc.)
- Names, emails, birthdays

2. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?

- Violation of Privacy Rights
  - PII includes sensitive information such as full name, address, social security number, etc.
  - Sharing this information without consent can be a violation of privacy rights
- Increased Risk of Identity Theft and Fraud
  - PII is often used by criminals to steal identities and commit fraud
  - Sharing PII can increase the risk of identity theft and fraud
- Legal Consequences
  - Many laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, regulate the handling of PII
  - Sharing PII without proper safeguards and consent can result in legal consequences
- Damaged Reputation
  - Sharing PII can damage the reputation of both the individual and the organization involved
  - Trust and credibility can be lost, leading to negative consequences for both parties

3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

- Characteristics of Good Passwords

  - Length
    - Longer passwords are more secure
  - Complexity
    - A mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols makes a password stronger
  - Uniqueness
    - Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdate, name, etc.
  - Regular Updates
    - Regularly changing passwords adds an extra layer of security

- Characteristics of Bad Passwords

  - Short Length
    - Shorter passwords can be easily cracked
  - Lack of Complexity
    - Using only letters or simple patterns makes passwords easy to guess
  - Commonness
    - Using commonly used passwords such as "password123" or "123456" is not secure
  - Infrequency of Updates
    - Not regularly changing passwords leaves the password vulnerable to being cracked

- Additional Step for Authentication
  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    - Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of identification, such as a fingerprint or code sent to a phone
    - Increases the difficulty for unauthorized access to an account

4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

- Symmetric Encryption

  - Definition
    - Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption of data
  - Process
    - The sender and receiver must both have the same key in order to encrypt and decrypt the data
  - Advantages
    - Faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption
    - Suitable for large amounts of data

- Asymmetric Encryption
  - Definition
    - Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys for encryption and decryption of data
  - Process
    - The sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the data, and the recipient uses their private key to decrypt the data
  - Advantages
    - More secure than symmetric encryption
    - Suitable for exchanging small amounts of data, such as keys for symmetric encryption

5. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.

- SSH into AWS Box
  - Definition
    - Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol used for secure access to remote servers
  - Use in AWS Deployment
    - SSH is used to securely log into an AWS instance and manage it from a remote location
  - Process
    - A user generates an SSH key pair, with a private key kept on their local machine and a public key added to the AWS instance
    - The user can then use the private key to log into the AWS instance and securely access and manage it
  - Advantages
    - Provides secure access to AWS instances
    - Enhances the security of data by avoiding the need to transmit login credentials over the network

6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

- Hypothetical Phishing Scheme

  - Definition
    - A phishing scheme is a fraudulent attempt to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information, by posing as a trustworthy entity
  - Example
    - A phishing email that appears to be from a well-known bank or financial institution, asking the recipient to click on a link to update their account information
    - The link takes the recipient to a fake website that looks like the real bank's site, where they are prompted to enter their login credentials and other sensitive information
  - Result
    - If the recipient enters their information, the phisher can use it to access their accounts and steal their money or sensitive data

- Other Phishing Techniques
  - Email Spoofing
    - Creating fake emails that appear to be from a trusted source, such as a bank or a friend
  - Social Engineering
    - Manipulating people into revealing confidential information, such as passwords or credit card numbers
  - SMiShing
    - Phishing attacks via text message
  - Vishing
    - Phishing attacks via phone calls
  - Spear Phishing
    - Targeted phishing attacks that use personal information, such as the recipient's name, to make the email appear more credible
