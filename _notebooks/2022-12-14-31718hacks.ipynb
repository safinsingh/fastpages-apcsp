    "The main difference between the two functions is that the first function uses a loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to `n`, while the second function uses a mathematical formula to compute the sum directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first function, sum_range_slow, the loop will execute `n+1` times, which means that the time it takes to execute this function will be proportional to n, the input size. This is known as having a linear time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the second function, sum_range_fast, uses a mathematical formula to compute the sum of the range of numbers from 0 to `n` in a single step, without using a loop. As a result, the time it takes to execute this function does not depend on the size of the input, `n`. This is known as having a constant time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, algorithms with a lower time complexity will be more efficient and faster than algorithms with a higher time complexity, especially when the input size is large. In this case, the second function is much more efficient than the first one because it has a constant time complexity, while the first one has a linear time complexity.\n",
