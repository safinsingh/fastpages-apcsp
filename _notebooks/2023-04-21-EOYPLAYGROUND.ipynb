    "The given Python code is an implementation of a two-player Tic Tac Toe game on the command line. The game board is represented using a 2D array of size 3x3. The print_board() function prints the current state of the board, while the check_win(player) and check_tie() functions determine if a player has won or if the game is tied, respectively. The play_game() function handles the main game loop, prompting players to enter their moves and updating the board state accordingly. 2D arrays are used extensively in the code to represent and manipulate the game board, with nested loops used to iterate over the rows and columns of the board to print its state and check for wins and ties.\n",
