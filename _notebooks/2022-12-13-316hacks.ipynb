    "Idea for a simulation: a platformer game that uses real physics to account for the movement of the character. Uses arrow keys for control and implements friction, gravity, and restitution forces/constants. An advantage of this simulation is that it lets us model real-life physical interactions with precision. I think a computer-generated simulation would be better in this case because it can be used for much more complex models/masses and tested multiple times."

    "The rolling dice example is a simulation because the number is programatically generated and no dice is truly rolled. The builtin pseudorandom number generator uses the computer's current precise time to generate a number between 0 and 1. This number is then multiplied/shifted by a constant to account for the range. This allows the \"dice\" to be rolled multiple times. An advantage of this simulation is that many trials (millions-billions) can be simulated and analytics can be performed immediately rather than physically gathering data and then performing statistics on it. An experiment would not be better in this situation because of the aforementioned advantages that the computer simulation provides.\n",
