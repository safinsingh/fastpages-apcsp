# Hi, I'm Safin

Welcome to my blog!

I'm a self-taught high school student with a passion for cybersecurity, math,
and full-stack web development. I'm a 3x CyberPatriot National Finals champion
and have won many hackathons and other STEM competitions. I love to take part in
organizations to educate and benefit others, and I'm a great team player! I'm
constantly learning and I have experience with many modern frameworks,
languages, and technologies. Feel free to reach out, I'm always open to new
opportunities! 

Here's my [actual website](https://safin.dev) and [LinkedIn
page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/safinsingh/). Go check out my posts below!
